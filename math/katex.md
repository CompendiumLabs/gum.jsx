# KaTeX coverage

What of KaTeX's command surface `src/elems/math.ts` renders, how, and what is still missing. gum parses TeX with katex's parser (`__parse`, katex 0.16.33 from `node_modules`) and converts the parse tree into gum math elements; this file is the map of that conversion. The test corpus that pins it down is listed at the end.

**Coverage.** 41 of katex's 57 parse-node types convert (nine more never leave the parser); all 33 environments lay out; every KaTeX face is loaded; 1447 of 1457 math symbols and 727 of 733 text symbols draw, the misses being glyphs no KaTeX face carries. The gaps are `\middle`, `\tag`, the arrows of the `CD` environment, and three exotic enclosures — see *Outstanding* below. The suite runs 119 passed, 0 failed.

## How it works

**Parse.** `parse_math` calls katex with `displayMode` derived from the current math style — the AMS multiline environments (`align`, `gather`, `equation`, `split`, `alignat`, `subarray`) are gated on it in katex's *parser*, not its builder — and a `strict` handler that silences only `newLineInDisplayMode`. A parse failure renders the raw TeX in red.

**Convert.** `convert_tree(tree, ctx)` is a straight recursion over node types, with a `ConvertCtx { attr, style, size }` threaded down: `attr` carries anything that flows to every leaf — `font_family` from font commands, `color` from `\color`/`\textcolor` — `size` is the `\tiny` … `\Huge` multiplier in force, and `style` is one of TeX's eight styles (`display`/`text`/`script`/`scriptscript`, each optionally `-cramped`), which drives script and fraction placement and the 0.7/0.5 scaling of `scale_math`. Fragments (`color`, `mathchoice`, `hbox`, an unbraced `sizing` body) return a `MathText` whose items are spliced into the parent row, so they space against their neighbours as in TeX; anything that must behave as one atom is wrapped with `seal_math`.

**Metrics.** Every element carries a `MathSpec`: the atom classes `left`/`right` (for inter-atom spacing and binary cancellation), `advance`, `vrange` and `vanchor` (the layout box about an anchor on the math axis), `italic` (superscript overhang), `scale` (so `baseline_extents` knows where a scaled item's baseline is), and two optional ink overhangs — `hrange`, the horizontal ink range when it differs from `[0, advance]` (`\rlap`, cancel strokes), and `vink`, the vertical one when it differs from `vrange` (`\smash`, `\cancel` on a single character). `metrics_bounds` is the layout box, `metrics_rect` the ink box; `place_items` and `layoutMathRow` place children by the latter and stack by the former, and record the group's own overhang from the hull.

**Fonts.** `TEX_FONT_FAMILY` is katex's `fontMap` (`mathbf` → Main-Bold, `mathcal` → Caligraphic, …); `text_font_family` composes the `\text*` family, weight and shape so `\textbf{\textit{x}}` is bold italic and `\emph` toggles. `MathSymbol` honours a requested face only where it has the glyph (`resolve_font_override`), falling back to the symbol's own face as katex's `makeOrd` does — which is also how `\boldsymbol` gets Math-BoldItalic letters and Main-Bold operators, and why `\mathcal{a}` and `\mathbb{1}` come out in the default face rather than as notdef boxes. Faces are registered one name per file for measurement (`KaTeX_Main-Bold`) but emitted as base family plus `font-weight`/`font-style` (`fontFace`), which is how fontconfig and `katex.min.css` know them.

**Drawn shapes.** What no font carries is drawn: stretchy accents, extensible arrows and braces (`MathStretch`, `MathBrace`), the `\oiint` ring (`MathOval`), cancel strokes (`MathCancel`), rules and array lines (`MathRule`, `array_rules`). Strokes are given in em — these groups rebase the context's stroke unit to their own pixels per em — and they take their colour from `color` when one is in force, otherwise the theme's rule fill, so they follow the text in dark mode. Delimiters follow TeX's rule in `fit_delim`: the first of Main, Size1…4 whose natural extent covers the requirement, unscaled, and only beyond Size4 a stretched glyph; `\big`…`\Bigg` feed katex's `sizeToMaxHeight` (1.2/1.8/2.4/3.0 em) into the same search.

**Arrays.** Every tabular environment is the one `array` node, implemented as `MathArray` with LaTeX's own metrics (`\arraystretch`, `\arraycolsep`, `\jot`, the per-row strut), and matches katex's height and depth to within 0.008 em across all of them. `\substack`, `\\` row breaks and `\\[len]`, `\hline`/`\hdashline`, `|`/`:`/`||` separators and `l`/`c`/`r` columns come with it.

**Strict mode** (`src/lib/strict.ts`). Every fallback is silent by default: parse errors become red text, an unhandled node an empty spacer, an unknown command name is drawn verbatim, a missing glyph is measured as `.notdef`. `strict: true` (on `evaluateGum`, `mathToSvg`/`mathToElement`/`mathToPng`/`mathToKitty`, and `--strict` on `gum`/`gum-tex`) throws a `StrictError` of kind `parse`, `node`, `symbol`, `font` or `glyph` instead. `scripts/test.ts` renders strictly to decide pass/fail and permissively for the report; an example that means to exercise a fallback opts out with `@nostrict` (`math_parse_error.jsx` is the only one).

## Gotchas

- **katex version.** Parsing is 0.16.33; `\overbracket`, `\underbracket` and text-mode `·` exist only from 0.18.4, so they parse-error. A version bump, not a gap.
- **`\\` outside an array** is a no-op in LaTeX display mode and is dropped (`cr`); katex's warning for it is silenced at the parse call. Nothing else in katex's strict warnings is.
- **`\tag`** parses (because display mode is on) into an unsupported node and drops silently rather than showing red source.
- **Nested sizing** is relative to the size in force — `\tiny a \small b` sets b at 0.9, not 0.45 — the `sizing` branch converts its body with `size` set to the new multiplier and scales the result by the ratio to the enclosing one.
- **`\color` is a fragment**: `\color{red}{2 +} 3` spaces like `2 + 3`.
- **`\vert`/`\Vert`/`|`** have glyphs only in Main and Size1 (real TeX builds tall bars from extensible pieces), so `fit_delim` skips faces without the glyph and stretches the largest that has it.
- **`\boxed{x}`** is `\fbox{$\displaystyle{x}$}`, so its body arrives wrapped in text-mode styling nodes; `\hbox` bodies are text-style, so `\frac` inside `\vcenter{\hbox{…}}` is small unless written `\dfrac`.
- **Overhang is not clipping-safe.** A group's coord is its ink hull, so `hrange`/`vink` overhang draws; but `MathSpan` does not carry a glyph's own italic overhang as `hrange`, which is the big-operator clipping listed below.
- **`\mathbb` lowercase/digits, `\origof`/`\imageof`, thorn/eth** have no glyph in any KaTeX face; the first falls back to the default face, the rest draw `.notdef` — katex draws tofu for them too.
- **`\href` `\url` `\html*` `\includegraphics`** need katex's `trust` option; untrusted they arrive as `color` nodes and draw as error-coloured text, exactly as katex does.

## Outstanding

Needs new structure:

| gap | why |
| --- | --- |
| `\middle` | The delimiter is sized to the *enclosing* `\left…\right` body, so it cannot be built bottom-up. The fix: `leftright` splits its body on the middle nodes, converts each run, then fits left, middles and right against the combined extent. |
| `\tag` | Sets its number at the *margin* of the display, which needs a measure gum's naturally-sized math box does not have. Wants a display container that knows its width. |
| `CD` environment (`cdlabel`, `cdlabelparent`) | The array lays out; the arrows are per-cell stretchy arrows sized to their column and labelled above and below, plus vertical arrows spanning rows. New assembly, not a new shape. |
| script-style fraction and delimiter metrics | Script-style fractions drift from katex, and in script style katex's delimiter sequence can pick a text-size Main glyph larger than the local em, so `x^{\binom{n}{k}}` is ~0.3 em short. Accuracy work in `fit_delim`/`Frac`. |
| big-operator ink overhang | A row ending in `\oint` or `\iiint` (Size2) is clipped at the right: the glyph's ink runs past its advance and `MathSpan` does not carry that as `hrange`. Needs an ink-wide `coord`/`aspect` on `MathSpan` that still keeps the glyph at the left of its box. |

Won't fix: `\phase` `\angl` `\angln` (the three exotic `enclose` labels — steinmetz and actuarial angles; the body still renders and strict mode reports the dropped decoration), and the no-glyph symbols above.

## Tests

All in `test/code/`, one feature per file, run strictly by `bun scripts/test.ts` (119 passed, 0 failed; no false positives in `docs/` or `gala/`). Rows keep surviving anchor terms (`1 + … + 2`) so a dropped construct reads as a hole rather than a blank card. Nothing in *Outstanding* has a test today; a one-line `math_middle.jsx` with `\left( a \middle| b \right)` is the one to add back when that lands.
