# Stack

*Inherits*: [Group](/docs/Group) > [Element](/docs/Element)

Stack one or more **Element** either vertically or horizontally. There are specialized components **VStack** and **HStack** that don't take the `direc` argument. This element handles child positioning and sizing, so any child `pos`/`size` arguments will be overridden. Proportional spacing between children can be specified with the `spacing` parameter.

The simplest case is when all children have aspect ratios. In the **HStack** case, the overall aspect ratio of the stack is the sum of the child aspect ratios. Children are allocated space in proportion to their aspect ratios. The **VStack** case is similar, but we need to deal in inverse aspect ratio terms.

When some children lack aspect ratios, they will be allocated any remaining space evenly. Regardless of whether a child has an aspect ratio or not, it can be given a fixed size with the `stack-size` parameter. This is specified as a fraction between 0 and 1, independent of spacing.

Whenever possible, the aspect ratio of the overall stack is set so that all elements with defined aspect ratios will reach full width (in the **VStack** case) or full height (in the **HStack** case).

Child parameters:
- `stack-size` = `null` — the child's relative share of the available space along the stack axis

Parameters:
- `direc` — the direction of stacking: `v` or `h`
- `spacing` = `0` — total amount of space to add between child elements
- `justify` = `center` — how to justify children along the stack axis
- `even` = `false` — whether to distribute sizes evenly (`stack-size = 1 / n`)
